# ReliQ: Lattice Field Theory for Mere Mortals
[![License: GPL v2](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](https://github.com/ctpeterson/ReliQ/blob/main/LICENSE)

`ReliQ` is an experimental data-parallel lattice field theory (LFT) framework written in the [Chapel](https://chapel-lang.org/) programming language. We believe that performance, simplicity, and reliability should not be at odds; as such, the primary objective of `ReliQ` is to provide base-level parallel data structures and algorithms that prioritize
* performance and scalability;
* hardware/vendor-agnosticism;
* ease-of-use and user-friendliness;
* reliability across application domains;
* and interoperability with existent LFT frameworks.

Please note that `ReliQ` is in the early development stage; i.e., it is not ready for production. You can follow `ReliQ`'s progress by clicking `Watch` on the top right corner of our [GitHub](https://github.com/ctpeterson/ReliQ) page.
